# Hello there, I'm Murilo

I am currently studying Computer Science at Maring√° State University (UEM) to pursue my bachelor's degree, and I'm always looking foward
to learning new things.

The languanges I am most familiar with are Python, C# and C, although I have worked with others to a lesser degree and have interest to learn new technologies & meet new people, and I can speak portuguese (native languange) and english (profficient - C2).

You can reach me through my personal email at muriloluiscalvoneves2004@hotmail.com, or if it is related to university matters, through
